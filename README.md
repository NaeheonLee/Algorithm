# Algorithm

To review and practice Data Structure and Algorithm

Started from 01/18/2021

### Goal
> Review Data Structure and Algorithm to be a "REAL" Computer Engineering/ Data Scientist

### Plan
> Take online classes from edwith
  - Python Data Structure
  - MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithm
  - 데이터 구조 및 분석 : Linear Structure and Dynamic Programming
> 5 problems each week with easy algorithm problems 
> Read and practice 'Cracking the Coding Interview 189 Programming Questions and Solutions' by Gayle L. Macdowell
> Keep going until my muscle memories know how to code

### Language
> Python
