# Algorithm

To rewind and practice Data Structure and Algorithm

Started from 01/18/2021

### Goal
> Rewind Data Structure and Algorithm to be a "REAL" Computer Engineering/ Data Scientist

### Plan
> 1. Take online classes from edwith
  + [Python Data Structure](https://www.edwith.org/introalgorithm)
  + [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithm](https://www.edwith.org/introalgorithm)
    + [MIT open course ware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/#)
  + [데이터 구조 및 분석 : Linear Structure and Dynamic Programming](https://www.edwith.org/datastructure-2019s#)
> 2. Five problems each week with easy algorithm problems 
> 3. Read and practice 'Cracking the Coding Interview 189 Programming Questions and Solutions' by Gayle L. Macdowell
> 4. Keep going until my muscle memories know how to code

### Language
> Python

### 문제 출처 사이트
> + 백준 : https://www.acmicpc.net/
> + 프로그래머스 : https://programmers.co.kr/
> + 코드 포스 : https://codeforces.com/
